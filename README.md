# Multiplier_with_data_and_control_path
In a complex digital system, the hardware is typically partioned into two parts: 
a) Data Path, which consists of the functional units where all computations are carried out. 
 Typically consists of registers, multiplexers, bus, adders, multipliers, counters, and other functional blocks. 
b) Control Path, which implements a finite-state machine and provides control signals to the data path in proper sequence. 
 In response to the control signals, various operations are carried out by the data path. Also takes inputs from the data path regarding various status informa@on
