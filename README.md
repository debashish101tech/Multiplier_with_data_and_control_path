# Multiplier_with_data_and_control_path
In a complex digital system, the hardware is typically partioned into two parts: 
a) Data Path, which consists of the func@onal units where all computa@ons are carried out. 
 Typically consists of registers, mul@plexers, bus, adders, mul@pliers, counters, and other func@onal blocks. 
b) Control Path, which implements a finite-state machine and provides control signals to the data path in proper sequence. 
 In response to the control signals, various opera@ons are carried out by the data path. â€¢ Also takes inputs from the data path regarding various status informa@on
